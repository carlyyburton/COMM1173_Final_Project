    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Communication happens in all sorts of settings and manners, but sometimes it can be incredibly ineffective. Planning is a strategy that can help negate this when executed well. The resource cited explains communication planning in the context of business, and uses the example of the Tide Pod challenge debacle. How would a company respond to customers using their product in a harmful manner, and manage to stay a respected company? Communication planning navigates this type of situation, including both formal and informal settings or business situations, by determining the right message to send based on the audience and method of communication.</p>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Planning doesn’t always have to be formal and written out. Day-to-day planning can simply be a form of thinking and reflecting on how your message is interpreted by the other person, and how they might respond. This strategy is also useful in project group settings. For example, when starting a new project, it’s necessary to determine which channel you’re communicating with, and what level of formality to use within the group. Planning can help bring ideas to a person or group in just the right way that they’ll be accepted.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Although the resource from Hubspot focuses on business communication more than personal communication, the information helps build off the knowledge found in this course. Making a communication plan for a business setting involves an audit of the organization to understand and work around potential problems. Following this, the audience has to be identified, as well as the channel, so that the message can be catered to fit both. The actual planning of the communication can be broken down into a section where the messages, audience, and channel are written down on a chart or table to be as clear as possible. After doing this, the people in charge of this communication structure their plan, determine who delivers the message, and after it’s delivered, reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Many of the steps outlined in Hubspot’s article align and expand upon the idea of purpose, audience, channel, and tone, or PACT, which is structuring a message based on these four factors.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;"How to Write an Effective Communications Plan [+ template]" offers many other types of communication plan templates for different types of business communications. For instance, handling a project involves planning and keeping track of goals, meetings, stakeholders, and resources, while corporate or crisis plans involve more organization functions and predetermined business responses. This resource implements planning into real life in plausible and well outlined manners, and can help someone with a future in business understand the necessity of this strategy. The second resource listed, Developing a Plan For Communication, is well laid out for anyone who wishes to read more about creating a message for a specific audience, and channel, but doesn’t want to read it for a business setting. It goes into depth about most of the same ideas as the first resource, but also offers information about mood, and an extensive list of channels.</p>
