    <h2>Reflecting</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Reflecting often refers to the process of thinking deeply and analyzing an experience, event, or situation. It can be used to gain a deeper insight to understanding one’s self, promote critical thinking and develop problem solving skills. Reflection can be used in a variety of different settings such as, personal, professional, and educational. It is a tool that can be used to achieve a greater understanding of an experience or situation by identifying areas of growth and improvement.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In this resource, a model that is well developed is used as a guide for reflection. Its purpose is to be used to work through an experience that is either stand-alone or in repeated situations. It was created in 1988 by Graham Gibbs who is a national teaching fellow and expert in qualitative research methods. This framework allows the user to learn and plan from experiences that either went well or didn’t go well. This resource can be helpful for decision making, productivity, communication and professional development.  It explores emotions, thoughts, and actions that occurred during and after the experience to reflect on for future experiences.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This resource utilizes 6 stages in its reflection process, each stage offering different open-ended question prompts for the experience. These question prompts that are given in the resource can help the user become more aware of your own communication habits and how they impact yourself and others. When we reflect on what others have said, we are actively listening to their words, which can lead to better understanding of that person's perspective. This can also avoid misunderstandings and mistakes. This resource can be used in different contexts such as personal, professional, or educational development.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;While the questions provided for each stage of the model are helpful, this resource lacks guidance on how to use those questions effectively. It would be helpful to users if they provide some tips on how to avoid common mistakes when using this specific model for reflection. It would also be helpful if this model provided an example from beginning to end to show the compilation of questions and answers.</p>
