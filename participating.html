    <h2>Participating</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In communication, participating usually involves actively engaging in an interaction, contributing thoughts and ideas and giving feedback to achieve a universal understanding. Actively participating in conversations can build stronger relationships, gain new insights, and develop new skills. This article written by Oliver Bates discusses why participation is important, in the context of community. It explores how encouraging individuals to get involved in their communities decision-making processes can be beneficial. It feels good to have your voice heard and to be a part of the decision making process, hear different perspectives, and receive feedback. This participation approach is based on sharing of information, opinions and perceptions with all parties involved. It stresses the significance of different perspectives in the process of decision making and how these different perspectives expand options and enhance the value of the final decision.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Overall participation helps build connections, promotes diversity, improves decision making processes, and helps individuals grow personally and professionally.</p>
